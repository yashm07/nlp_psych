       " 'My best attempt at putting my feelings into words Why is suicide looked down upon People say “it’s not an option” or say it’s selfish I would agree that there is a degree of selfishness to suicide but using that as a reason for why it is a bad thing is nothing but hypocrisy To tell someone who wants to die to keep living is the equivalent of telling a nonsuicidal person to kill themselves It’s like saying “why can’t you just ignore all of your pain so Iwe don’t have to be sad if you die” Ok sure I get that making people sad is a bad thing  but the fact that people think this is somehow less selfish than killing yourself is absurd Also huge fuck off to anyone saying “it will get better it’s worth it to keep living there’s so much good in the world” Better isn’t good enough No amount of “good” or “happiness” will make it worth it There hasn’t been a day where I thought “I’m glad I made it this far” Even on the trip of a lifetime with everything anyone could ask for I still would’ve traded it all away to have been dead a few years earlier All you are saying when you tell someone “it will get better it’s worth it” is that you have no idea what you’re talking about I’m sure your intentions are good but it makes exactly 0 sense to keep someone who’s attempted suicide multiple times and still wants to die around The only reasons are those pertaining to how other people feel about their loss I don’t want to get better I want to be donefuck your loss I don’t know why people lie through their teeth telling themselves that it’s worth it or that they are happy I don’t know what sense of fulfillment people get by droning on consuming resources and endlessly fighting for happiness Why Why go through all that effort Because for most people it’s easier than considering death due to our deeply embedded instinct for survival The problem is that some of us recognize when survival instincts drive what we do and once this happens the whole illusion falls apart Now for me eating is tedious sex drive is an annoyance and taking care of my body a never ending exhausting chore I want to do none of these things but my body forces me to My body tries to trick me into thinking that these are good things and most are fooled and even value these feelings The easiest to explain as it’s the only one not tied to living is sex drive desire to have kids I do feel lustsexual attraction but it is painfully obvious that I don’t actually want to have sex my instincts simply use hormones to make me think that I want to Then neurotransmitters are released in the brain to reward giving into these instincts for the purpose of prolonging human existence Well nowadays reproduction is more of a problem for our survival than a help leaving it with no value actually even negative value after the optimal amount of new people have been born The desire to have kids is even more selfish than asking a suicidal person to keep living When you have kids because you want to you are bringing someone into this world just because you seek a feeling of importance or belonging or accomplishment Then you say that suicide isn’t an option leaving the hypothetical child stuck in existence with the only reason for said existence being you felt “incomplete” All I’m really trying to say is in a world with too many people why do we force people against their will to keep living “If you end it now you won’t get to experience what may be the best part of your life” Not like I’ll be around to regret it“So many people love you”Then they should want me to be in pain as little as possible“Life gets so much better”Better is not nearly good enough I honestly would rather die right now than live through another year of this even if the rest of my life is completely happy“But your so young”The longer I live statistically speaking the more likely I am to kill myself Also I’m way too old I wish I died as an infant or even better not born at all At 20 I already see my body decaying and why THE FUCK would I want to live on as my body gets weaker when I already don’t want to live “Depression is a mental illness you’re mind is sick these thoughts have no value”Well they are my only thoughts and like I said I have no desire to “get better” so either let me die in peace or just keep dragging my limp existence through life just so you don’t have to feel sad fucking prick“Your depression is just an irregular amount of chemicals in your brain you just don’t produce enough serotonin”So is literally every emotion You don’t hear me saying “you don’t actually love her your brain just knows that having a partner makes survival more likely as well as providing ample opportunity for procreation You’re actually just feeling high levels of dopamine serotonin and oxytocin in your brain When you find someone that could make a suitable long term mate your brain makes you feel connected to them to make you go out of your way to protect them” because that would be a rude borderline sociopathic thing to say yes that is how it feels when you tell me thisI’m not saying that the world or life for that matter is bad it’s just not for me',\n",

       " 'AA is Harmful Please Beware  AA begins and ends with shame and condemnation We are told that this organization is the premiere way for people suffering from substance addiction to receive help Nothing is further from the truth While some recent articles have finally questioned the actual results of the organization I want to go one step farther by acknowledging how far from being a benign failure AA is actually dangerous and harmful to overwhelming majority of addicts and nonaddicts alike This is because AA has almost singularly defined what it means to be a substance user In short AA invented the Addict And they still control the very definition of that dirty word The articles that have come out recently that are critical of AA have mainly focused on the ineffective success rate of the AA program Most authors site  at most  a 5 to 7 success rate for AA participants This number is shockingly low and researchers from our best institutions have noted that the AA success rate is actually far lower than the rate of those people who just decide to quit on their own  socalled spontaneous remissionWell you may ask what about the people who do claim that AA has saved their lives isnt the program helping them stay sober And almost every author who is critical of AAs abysmal success rate eventually cedes the point that AA does in fact help some people They do They help some people Really Who are these lucky onesWhile it is true that some people usually the proverbial oldtimers seem to stay sober mostly from AA they do not do so in spite of all the other people failed by the program Rather they stay sober by exploiting and demonizing the very people whom they and the program have failedAfter attending countless AA meetings I believe that oldtimers even those who diligently work their programs actually survive by wielding power over and exploiting other substance abusers controlling new members and ultimately by demonizing those people who choose use drugs and alcohol  usually by turning other users into scapegoats and pariahs\\xa0Their rigid definition of the drug user  The Addict  serves not to help the user but rather to create a boogieman or enemy out there\\xa0And this is how the old tiers stay sober they construct an external enemy and they try to stay sober by rallying one day at a time against\\xa0that enemy Their boogieman  The Addict  assumes a contradictory tripartite\\xa0identity one part blameless victim one part perpetually diseased person and one part morally flawed condemned soul But users and people with substance issues are not boogiemen they are not our enemies Rather they are our loved ones people in our families our neighbors our coworkers our friends and sometime our selves\\xa0Am I overreacting No Most people who have attended more than a couple of meetings and then decided at AA wasnt for them are left with a couple of inescapable observations\\xa0 The first is how AA always tends to facilitate an us versus them mentality in their members People who believe in AA especially those pesky oldtimers believe that they have found the one and only route to true sobriety and salvation  irrespective of any actual medical or psychological research No other methods of recovery or harm reduction are ever acknowledged as valid within the program or at a meeting Far from it those brave enough to mention alternatives are quickly given the cold shoulder by more established members The message is always the same without AA your disease will progress and you will die\\xa0Even those folks who achieve abstinence apart from AA are still derided as dry drunks and as being in denial and simply bidding their time till relapseAnd why do adherents to the program cultivate such as an us versus them youre in or youre out with us or against us youre among the chosen people or youre among the condemned people kind of attitude One reason Control Most of these oldtimers achieve sobriety and the appearance of control in other areas of their life mainly by exerting interpersonal control over others  usually the most vulnerable andor newcomers to their AA meetingBut you may ask isnt their need for control  to give unchallenged directions  benign or even beneficial if it helps other addicts stay sober After all arent these sorry people just in need of some Good Orderly Direction another one of their crazy acronyms for god But the fact is that power and control are never just neutral never simply benign And covering up the need for power and control with talk of spirituality and a higher power makes it only more dangerous  especially for the vulnerable newcomerAA seeks to control its members in numerous ways Youre forced to share to the group revealing your inmost conflicts and foibles for others to judge This is one of the first steps of many into lifelong shame and condemnationYou are told to get a sponsor This sponsor chimes in on almost every aspect of your life even those areas that have seemingly nothing to do with your substance use Sponsors receive no special training or qualifications and are usually illequipped to advise people on their most pressing problems These relationships always involve the sponsor exerting their power over the newcomer in countless waysNewcomers are told how many meeting they need to attend often 90 meetings in 90 days what book to read always read the Big Book and how to think think like the Home Group However the advice of the sponsor almost never stops there Newcomers are advised on who to associate with and who not to associate with They are frequently given career advice and are given directions on how to deal with spouses families and loved ones Unsurprisingly much of this advice is hogwash And frequently the demands of a sponsor lead to frayed social relationships with nonAA members and isolation outside of the AA organizationThere has not yet been a formal study as to how many people get divorced as a result of following the directions of their AA group or sponsor but the anecdotal evidence suggests a staggeringly large number Newcomers are often encouraged to drop their relationships with nonAA members and are encouraged to only have romantic connections with those in the programBut the need of AAers to perpetuate their beliefs harms far more than just the unwitting newcomer AA has ingrained in our collective consciousness the very idea of what it means to be a substance user The Addict  and this is where their harm is most insidious and pervasive Without any medical backup they contend that someone with a substance problem is once and forever an addict This idea is found in the very preface of their organizations holy text the Big Book under the disingenuous title The Doctors Opinion\\xa0The problem with this idea is that it leads people into accepting the idea that they are terminally ill or at least terminally deficient and powerless  but this simply is not usually the case The truth is that for most people substance abuse is not a lifelong condition that needs to be managed with constant meetings and sponsorship Their rigid disease model actually serves to keep people away from other helpful alternatives such as behavioral therapy membership in positive social groups or harm reduction\\xa0They also perpetuate the idea that the addict is a person of uniquely flawed character  one of the condemned who needs AAs saving At its face this is contradictory is the addict somebody who has a disease or is the addict somebody who has deeplyseated character flaws And it is this contradiction is at the heart of AAs religiosity and thinlyveiled religious ideologyAA has its roots in the Oxford Group a radical christian cult from the early twentieth century In fact the 12 Steps themselves are almost directly taken from the Oxford Groups cult methodology Central to the Oxford Groups ideology is the oldline protestant idea of Total Depravity  the idea that all human beings are inexorably into sin brokenness moral failure and rebellion This radical and detrimental belief is the underpinning of virtually all AA thought eg the addict is hopeless and powerless and needs the intervention of a higher power to get right\\xa0The doctrine of Total Depravity is much more than just a dusty old theological formulation It has real consequences for those belonging to a group operating on such a notions  and what a shame it is I believe that telling people over and over again that they are powerless and morally flawed only leads to greater and greater problems and dysfunctions with ones selfimage and ultimately ones behavior in the worldSo let me conclude with my original point AA is not a harmless organization Its an organization run by powerseeking individuals who often mess up the lives of those whom they purport to help Their most harmful invention is the identity of the modern addict  a caste or class of person they claim to be inexorably diseased as well as morally flawed And this classification of the addict is not just limited to AA meetings and their written propaganda That would be bad enough Rather their model of the addict has been perpetuated for almost a hundred years by television media the courts the prison industry religious authorities celebrities and by a multibillion dollar recovery industry In fact over 95 of private recovery programs are still based on the 12 Steps and their assumptions about the drug user  virtually without any empirical evidence of its effectivenessThe damage is not limited to the people who weave in and out of their meeting rooms  that would be bad enough The deepest harm from AA stems from their need to demonize and scapegoat the substance user  to cast the unrepentant user as inevitably among the condemned\\xa0 But we are not condemned Their organization only thrives so long as they are able to label nonadherents as depraved addicts who are at best in denial or drydrunks\\xa0 So long as AA propaganda dominates are collective conscious we are doing all doing a disservice for people who struggle with substance issuesAA can only thrive so long as they cast the unrepentant user as outsider condemned to a long and painful road to death But that is not the truth Drug users are not all suffering from character flaws Drug use does not make you condemned for life and most users do learn to quit or moderate without AA and then go on to live happy normal lifespans We need to cut through the fear and labeling that AA and the 12Step industry thrives on What we need is a new model for understanding the substance user not as somebody who is inherently flawed and diseased not as somebody who is morally disordered but as someone who could benefit from harm reduction psychological therapy and real medical treatment  as full human beings',\n",

       " 'Can you be depressed only if youre alone First Im not depressed at least compared to what I knowexperienced about depression I just want to get a few opinions about my current state I dont know if this is the correct sub to ask that but I think it fits The text might turn out a bit longer and English is not my first language sorry for that If anythings unclear just let me know Im a 20yo guy if that matters So basically I dont think that Im depressed but it feels like I am or close to being it I know that sounds weird but let me explain Im a person who loves to go out with friends and just have fun I like to make them smile and just enjoy my life I get along with most of my colleagues as well all together I dont have a problem socializing Im basically the oh that guy I dont really know him but he seems alright  guy at your school I dont have a problem with that even if no one actually knows me closer Thats okay for meAlso I cant complain about my life Ive got a job and a home However whenever Im on my own and Im not doing anything I just feel like Im completely lost Usually I get home at 5pm play guitar and do some running and thats it Im done Its not that I dont know what to do but simply that I dont want to do anything at all And as soon as that feeling starts my mind goes crazy and for example starts doubting everything thats gonna happen in the future and has happened in the past And I know that its stupid and I usually ignore it but it lowkey still hits meI dont get it For example I get home after playing Billard with my friends and instantly after I shut my door and wrapped myself in blankets it starts And always the same questions why do I even care and does someone actually care and what if and so on I simply dont know where that comes from Maybe its because I care more about others than about myself I actually had a relationship because of that She had clinical depression and attempted suicide a few times one time in front of me which was the first time I cried in over 8 years which isnt really normal as well but I knew that she wasnt depressed when she was with me She wasnt happy either but she wasnt depressed I obviously never told her but it was hell for me I didnt know if I would meet her the next day if she would response to my texts simply because for a moment depression wanted to end it not her But that was a while ago we broke up and Im fine now no worries That was just an example But that explains my mindset pretty well I really want to help others and Id take everything on me to make it work Its stupid its not good for my health I know but thats something I wont stop doing and something that Im sort of good at So back to the actual topic theres something else thats not normal or doesnt feel normal I dont show any sad emotions at all I dont even know if I feel them  correctly A while ago some family members and close friends passed away again Im alright no worries and the moment Ive got told about that I literally felt nothing at all and it really  scared me I never thought that I could be that cold and dont feel anything at all The only thing inside my head was shit why xyz and not me Actually I felt sad but not the kind of sad where you start crying The kind of sad where you just know that something bad happenedAnd lastly thinking about death I fear death I dont even like talking about it I fear it because I know that eventually Ill leave someone behind who loves me and simply thinking about that makes me emotional in fact more emotional than I felt when I heard that xyz died I really dont think that this is normal or good But at the same time I dont really care I mean I dont want to die and I want to live but at the same time I dont care if I die Usually I dont even tell anyone how am I feeling simply because I dont think that anyone would actually care and because I dont want to put my problems onto someone elses shoulders Sometimes I think it would help if there was someone I can come home to simply to sit next to me and just be there But that doesnt make any sense either I dont want to make anyones day worse because of me being in a mood In fact it all sounds stupid to me I feel like Im someone who just complains about something thats not important at all People would probably say meh hes just looking for attention etc There are people who have it worse I shouldnt be complaining Ive been ignoring that for years know I never told anyone about it and I never showed it I think it would be best if I kept doing that Everything that Ive written down kinda sums up whats on my mind before I sleep when I wake up or when Im alone But for example it doesnt happen when Im outside and just walk around or when I listen to music Im still alone but I dont think about that Only when theres nothing for me to do and I space out But I dont think Im depressed I cant be Ive got everything I need my life isnt that bad Why would I be depressed Everytime I think about that I always tell myself to man up and get over it Is that a sign of depression should I look for professional help or am I just in a mood everytime Im on my own I really appreciate any comment and wish you a nice day take care Youre great ',\n",

       " 'My mom Let me just start by saying that my mom has struggled with alcohol for my entire life To say the least she put time through a lot when I was younger But when she married my stepdad domesticity and the chance for a stable relationship put her on the eventual path to a 5 year sobriety that I thought would last She was sober through my high school years and for some time after I graduated Last year my stepdad threatened divorce because of a multitude of reasons He’s one of those people that doesn’t think raising kids suffices as a fulltime job He’s military so he works long hours and for as long as I can remember he thinks that bringing in income is the only role he plays in the family I have two younger siblings and my mom has been a housewife for the entire time that they’ve been married But even when she got a job working long hours he still wasn’t satisfied And yet during his time off he sits in front of his computer and games for hours Very seldom does he spend time with my siblings and he rarely talks to me Except that now he’s being strangely friendly towards me and strangely involved with my siblingsI could write paragraphs about the issues with their relationship and how he picks on my mom for things she likes and how she does things all the while trying to write it off as him trying to help her be “better” when really all it does is make her more insecure than she already is She always has been And I know that’s why she drinks Now my stepdad has finalized his decision to divorce her Why Because he feels like there’s something missing with their relationship Sex I’m certain is one of them Ugh But that’s not my business it’s not that she’s a horrible housewife as he’s so hatefully said before but recently retracted Or that he doesn’t “care” about her Supposedly he does He just isn’t in love with her anymore he says So he wants to divorce her He needs to look out for “his own happiness” That’s the painful truth that she won’t acceptSo now that the divorce has been set into motion my stepdad has taken on the bachelor life  going out spending money on meals and hotels and other things He’s gone for long hours at a time He even has taken up drawing as a hobby all of the sudden  which he has sort of picked on me for in the past That’s besides the point but also relevant because it’s one of the things that feeds into my mom’s behavior lately with the alcoholSo here’s where my frustration comes in As a result of my stepdad’s behavior going out spending money on himself even dipping into my mom’s allowance off of his paycheck for his own expenses And so my mom a person who struggles with insecurities finds alcohol to be the easiest thing to alleviate her stress and her emotions Except it doesn’t She’s a horrible drunk What ends up happening is that I end up taking responsibility for my siblings often without notice What prompted me to write this was that tonight which is a school night she went out and got drunk as a direct result of my stepdad going out to drink This left me with my siblings I also have responsibilities to attend to I love my siblings so much but I am not their mother They need their mother I have to be up at 5 am for work tomorrow morning so I am not able to take my brothers to school and there’s no one else who can If my mom can’t it falls on me Every TimeThis year before the divorce came about I had plans to not only start college but also to move out on my own I had planned to go to school from home but my stepdad has frequently pressured me to move out especially when he’s drunk which is when he’s more sociable it seems I also might add that he criticized my weight because I shared food that came from his paycheck So I’ve been buying my own food ever sinceAnyway I had planned to move out and start school and now my mom is getting a divorce and since she can’t stand being in the same area as my stepdad she’s probably moving out of the stateI have never lived on my own mind you and I’m still finding out how this whole “adulting” thing works I won’t always be there to watch after my siblings when she decides to become inebriated I wish she would ditch the alcohol I’ve considered recommended AlAnon to her but I have mentioned it briefly and she seemed to be opposed to the idea I need her to seek help I love her dearly and I’ve always been by her side but as much as I hate to say it if it weren’t for my brothers I would probably just leave and seldom speak to her unless she made an actual effort to stop drinking I am a person who hates to complain and who feels guilty for venting But I truly feel helpless I already suffer from issues of my own but I am slowly overcoming them without turning to alcohol I have tried to be supportive to my mom and not judge mental but she treats me one minute like I’m the best friend she has and another like this nagging crone who wants to spoil her fun I just need help Some words of advice some words of encouragement I need to scream in paragraphs into the void and perhaps get an answer that can let me know I’m not alone I just want to be happy I’m so afraid of the world and I’m trying to spread my wings and become part of it but I suffer from overprotective ness towards those I love and this situation with my mom is truly weighing on me In terms of what decisions she makes there is nothing I can technically do But perhaps I can help somehow in a way I haven’t thought of yet Not merely being a babysitter and a shoulder to cry on',\n",

       " 'Wait what Is it really possible I have ADHD  ADD  Guys I just wanted to thank you so much After years and years of struggle I think I may find at least a part of the answer whats wrong with me   Like 99 of my country including doctors I was always thinking about ADHD as an imaginary problem the justification for parents mistakes I was never treating it as any real problem  Since I can remember everyone starting from my parents and teachers were labelling myself as talented but lazy I was always distracted during the lessons I often forgot about homework I was constantly loosing my stuff Does anyone have spare pen to borrow   It was completely normal for me to stare at the window writing the test waking up suddenly just to fly away with my mind one minute later once again  Somehow I was always able to get away with it the talented part is quite strong in me D  When I grow up it was getting worse and worse I didnt finish my masters because of meeeeh  I am not able to create any schedule even simple stuff like paying the bills are making me anxious and I am delaying it to the point I need to pay the fines In my work its even worse  having quite nice job it happens when I am having the homeoffice day during entire day I will not do ANYTHING not even read the emails I will just sit in front of the computer doing nothing most likely fb + reddit I have failed because of it so many times that it makes me so anxious to the point it is causing delaying new tasks  like in a vicious circle  I am seeing guys from my team with great results although I know they are not smarter than me But you know what is different They are just getting stuff done Simple as that At one point of time I saw an ADHD article at Wikipedia I think I have read everything on Wiki Twice  I was like wait this looks similar in a way So I decided to go to the psychiatrist of course delaying making the appointment at least 10 times After I told her at the beginning  Hey I think I might have an ADHD she was like yeah yeah sure After over an hour of discussion I have left hers office with bunch of advises Try to organise your life Create an schedule and just execute it or understand what is distracting you Oh perfect useful as FK So I got frustrated I felt not understood and for few years I was still in this madness fighting with myself inside my mindBut then few days ago I have stumbled upon this sub What was different in here comparing to Wiki article is that in here I found real life stories not only the list of symptoms And woooow At first I was even overwhelmed with this For the first time in my life I saw something soooo related to my deepest thoughts It was like I was reading something I wrote about me Posts like ADHD is being angry at someone reminding a task you ask them to remind you  I have no idea how much fights with my girlfriend I have started because she was reminding me something I ask her to remind me This is literally driving me crazy because I know how much I am letting her down not doing the task at the first place and then how awful I am to blaming her for checking if I did it The best thing in ADHD is that you know basics of every hobby Wooooow it is so much me I have tried every hobby you could imagine From 3dPrinting to sailing from archaeology to knife making from antiques renovation to coding from photography to climbing etc etc I can literally discuss with anyone on everything Trivia contest Count me in Who want to be a millionaire  I could do that to be honest  I always wanted I just have never even try to register I want to do everything to a point where I d nothing  yup summarises my  professional and personal lifeThen the most important thing I have read here was the comparison of trying to focus on work having ADHD to crowd of people behind you each of them shouting different things When I read those comments here for the first time in my life I have felt like there is someone in the world understanding what I am dealing with Someone understanding the never ending fight inside my head Understanding this darkness in my mind blurring entire world preventing me from focusing on something for more than few minutes  Thank you guys It means a lot for me to understand this and even to share this story with anyone Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel gave me now a looot of confidence and inner calm Its like having a bit of hope after years of struggle I want now to see someone really specialised in adults ADHD I am aware that the therapy will not be a magic button changing everything immediately but for me now any change would be something huge  Please keep fingers crossed ',\n",

       " 'I want to find a link between super strength and autism I have a video in the post showing my unusual strength Im a mild autistic and want to prove my theory that there is a link between them can you help me Hi allIll try to write this in a few words Im trying to find evidence of a link between that genes that give us autistic traits and physical strength as it happens to me Ill explain below and have a video below for you to see its not a joke its a serious questionstudy I haveI think Autism could be a wonderful thing although I realize its not always the case But I found I was AspergerAutism Level 1 some weeks ago and everything in my life made more sense than beforeI tried to find out if I was when I found some hidden papers from my childhood telling that between 2 and 6 years old I was a more severe case of autism child not talking to anyone agressive isolating myself etc Between 6 and 8 I improved a lot Since then I had a wonderful life and nowadays Im just a mild autistic person and never imagined I wasAs I now know how to talk to people recognize sarcasm and use it almost eliminated my obsessive compulsive disorder got used to look peoples in the eyes doesnt mean I like it can make friends talk to strangers etcIm just very distracted which now I know its the reason that my relationships all went bad once I turned around and noticed that my girlfriend was 40 feet back staring at me saying «you werent listening to me you dont love me» etc so my distraction destroys relationships and I dont feel the need to be with people but besides that my life seems perfect this way I have 911 autistic traits from the known panflets about autism but always lived a neurotypical life + I even got to have perfect motor skills etcNow I learned that some of my physical traits came from Autism like my hypersensitivity to light my hypersensitivity to sounds even listen to my neighbours discussions pain tolerance probably my cold tolerance can stand below 0ºC 30 farenheit just in a tshirt not feeling coldAnd I know I have a really unusual strength I can roll 3 or 4 frying pans together as if they were mazagines I can bend horseshoes with my hands bend steel bars adjustable wrenches but having a height of 511 and a bodyweight of 140lbs body mass index 19 to 20 never had training beforeOf course then I started doing feats and improved but my base strength was too highCheck an examplehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=3zuabvEjcdQhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=3zuabvEjcdQI know I look pretty neurotypical but I guess nobody will say that to me here as Ive heard also from my friends that you dont look autistic I have grown to be almost neurotypical besides my ADHD walking on the street with mathematical patterns like fibonacci loving to be alone etc On the video I may look some neurotypical guy if thats what you might think but I still have 911 from the 14 basic autistic traitsThey say my brain compensated at my time there wasnt a 2e child I would be autistic or not autistic just that my mother insisted for me to go to a public school no special teaching and I adapted luckily because of my brain for what they say I learn everything very quickly am a selftaught polymathI cant go higher on my trainings because when bending unbraced using only hands or wrists steel bars that require above 600lbs of force to bend I start having blood coming out from the pores of my skin and hear my heartbeat intracranial blood pressure too high and risk of brain hemorrage etc so I stopped training because I found my bodys limits but not my strength limit thoughI think this may come from AutismI even made a video telling that to find others but its in a terrible Englishhttpswwwyoutubecomedito=Uampvideoid=Jy0K4UvVOo4httpswwwyoutubecomedito=Uampvideoid=Jy0K4UvVOo4I think it would be too much of a coincidence for me to have adapted to Society very well in my point of view because people say Im a little antisocial as Im very introvert but not shy and besides all the cool traits I had having also this huge physical strengthSo I thought it must have come from the Aspergers alsoAnd once someone told me like it seems you want to be like Da Vinci as I specialized in several areas like computer programming technical analysis on finantial markets etc but also painted created and play music etc And I answered No I would never be like him Ive very strong and he wasntAfter all I was mistaken Da Vinci was very very strong and was able to bend horseshoes with his hands like me And he was asperger like meSo there must be a link hereIm not saying all aspergers or autistic persons are very strong maybe its a rare gift but I believe there is a relationI thought in creating that video so that I would reach very strong and light some steel benders and oldtimestrongmen hoping some of them would be aspergersI thought that if there were like 1 aspergers in population or autistic persons like me and I would find 10 or 20 or 30 of Aspergers in the middle of the strongest guys Ive found there would be a linkBut they usually dont like the idea to do asperger tests some due to religion issues someone explained that it would lead to discussions others because they dont see themselves as autistic like I never did because I was ignorant in that area so I didnt have much luck convincing them to do the testsSo my only option left was to ask autistic persons like me if they knew cases of that And here I amThere is a point in this Oldtime strongmen in the past always said this Dennis Rogers sayshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=QJ8Lj1pA0WEamplist=PLswCft9xAHtEfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fHampindex=7ampt=0shttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=QJ8Lj1pA0WEamplist=PLswCft9xAHtEfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fHampindex=7ampt=0sThat each one has a governor our heads that limits us Like a chip in a car that if we take the chip out it would be a lot faster but blow up its engine sooner A measure to protect usSome say some persons have more tolerant governors letting them use more strenght when their lives are at risk they call it hysterical strength But its a rare phenomenon difficult to studyYou can see one explanation for thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=H8golExMhp4amplist=PLswCft9xAHtEfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fHampindex=8ampt=0shttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv=H8golExMhp4amplist=PLswCft9xAHtEfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fHampindex=8ampt=0sYou can see in the middle they notice he has a lot more muscle acceleration than usual He has a lot more muscle fibers being activated at once than the typical human being I have no clue if hes aspie or not thoughAnd this comes from our brains More muscle fibers activated at once by each motorneurons we have or having more motorneurons Or activating more than usual etc etcSo it comes from our minds as human beings are a lot stronger than we imagine we are just limited to a certain ammount of strength for our own sake And some persons can go beyond that having no limitsAs I have that rolling frying pans with my hands the first time Ive tried and adjustable wrenches with no train for 10 years before and 140lbs for 511 tall I have that surelyNow I was a more severe case of autism in childhood nowadays everybody think Im a typical neurotypical person but Im asperger stillThere must be a link Im certain of that And I notice certain oldtimestrongmen in the past like Mighty Atom in the US seemed Asperger to me introverts focused on certain hobbies etcOn the asperger section nobody had clear answers maybe here some of you haveDo you know examples of stronger than usual persons being autistic Specially Level 1 AutismAsperger to be sure it happens also in aspergers like me thats its a trai possible in mild autism alsoIf so tell me your opinion on this or where should I find examples I want to test my theory and find answers and know what gave me this strength Autism or I was simply gifted with strength alsoBy the way this is a serious question Im really interested to find out Im not claiming to be super man or somethingOr it would be very important if you know do you know some specialist that may study these things and give me answers Someone that studies autistic traits etcThanks',\n",

       " 'I have ADHD and study at Oxford University your ADHD cant stop you from achieving your dreams read this if youre struggling Hi all so I recently discovered this group and want to start of saying thank you to all of you for sharing your experiences It has helped me so much in understanding what ADHD is and realising Im not alone I am very grateful to every single one of you I finally made an account so I can do my bit to contribute   If youre having one of those days where you feel like youre a failure incapable lacking motivation blaming yourself etc I hope you read this and understand youre not alone but also that you can get through it and you have a lot to offer and to achieve These are thoughts Ive had to struggle with so I understand how it feels but essentially I hope this helps you realise it can get better So yeah I study at Oxford and I dont mean to suggest that if youre anywhere else that you are anything less What I mean is that Oxford was my dream and I reached it and whatever your dream is you can reach it too So here are the few things I want to say1 Your ADHD regardless of what youve been told or read cant stop you from achieving your dreams This sounds really cliche but its true  I got here before being diagnosed and receiving any treatment which certainly made it even more difficult but I want to just let you know that our ADHD makes us different but it doesnt make us any less capable  Some things are harder for us but we are also more creative empathetic passionate etc And these things that are harder we are still able to overcome them It may be difficult but with the right techniques and support we can still offer a lot to society 2 People may doubt us but ultimately what people think doesnt matter I wasnt the best at school and all my homework was either last minute or just not done I was and still am incredibly disorganised late forgetful talkative and just not the picture of ideal student This got me down a lot but also motivated me I knew that my teachers family and my friends didnt and still dont think I deserve to be at Oxford There isnt much I can do about this all I can do is prove them wrong This is all we can try to do when people doubt us And perhaps we are unable to prove them wrong it still doesnt make them right We know what were capable of what our potential is what we dream of and other people regardless of their position have no right nor justification for saying otherwise We know ourselves and our desires better than anyone else  This also applies to the diagnosis itself I struggled in getting a diagnosis and when I did no one really cared to understand or believe me They think I dont have it want it for the drugs exaggerate it or want it as an excuse for my lackings Once again this doesnt matter If you know your intentions and your doctor thinks you have it then it doesnt matter what other people think It would be great if people believed us when we try to explain how ADHD affects us but ultimately not all are willing and it hurts but the only people whose opinion matters are those who trust us and know us 3 Its okay to have off days and they might happen a lot or they might be rare but either way its okay  Its completely normal and reasonable to have times where you doubt yourself or the ADHD gets to you Its okay to not be happy all the time and its okay to struggle Ultimately you have something that affects you that others do not have to deal with and it can take its toll and its exhausting to deal with it and with the fallout of it But you tried your best so you cant blame yourself when things dont work out Be kinder to yourself There are lots of times where I analyse things Ive done or said and then blame myself and get really upset over it Its a horrible thought cycle to get into especially when your mind is already overactive and cant stop itself from itself In these times what I find useful is a journal and then writing down my thoughts and thinking through them rationally I write down each thought using arrows that lead to the next thought etc until I reach my conclusion But I try to be rational and fair on myself and this technique really helps 4 You may think my ADHD isnt that severe if I was able to get into Oxford undiagnosed  Im not the best academically and Ive been struggling a lot with the work since starting and I still feel I dont belong here and was accidentally let in but at the end of the day Im still here and things are improving I have my second year exams this term and I have been struggling the past few days but this subReddit really helped me and I feel motivated to not only prove people wrong but also prove myself right  And it is quite severe for me I have just learned lots of mechanisms to get through it5 Everything will be okay  Maybe not now and maybe not tomorrow but eventually things will be okay and youll be fine No matter what youre going through All pain is temporary Nothing lasts foreverTLDR You can achieve your dreams dont listen to other people dont doubt yourself its okay not to be okay you will get through this and you are capable of achieving whatever you set your mind

       " 'Campers amp Coercion I had to write this again bc I couldn’t crosspost it for some reason Sorry it’s long but venting is helping My backstoryI’m very soft spoken gentle amp introverted person by nature but became a loner from having a disability school bullying and a mentally abusive stepdad I survived most days by escaping to own imagination living vicariously through books and having the affection of pets When my “trauma” occurred I was in my mid 20s already in a dark state of mind contemplating suicide and having thoughts of murder I didn’t know how else my family and I could be free Anyway I decided one day that instead of one of us dying I still just wanted to be loved and a Prince Charming needed to save me And right away So I turned to online dating I wish I could take that one decision back A man from out of state but only a few hours away contacted and pursued me I still don’t remember any red flags or anything odd that stood out about him He told me he graduated from the college near me and had friends here still amp sometimes had to come back amp forth for work entirely plausible bc I know several other people that do the same thing We exchanged texts a few weeks of friendly banter amp flirtation It eventually got a lot more intense I had someone to talk to to trust Many people knew what my stepdad was like what my family was going through including other family amp church And they all looked the other way like it didn’t matter This guy paid attention to me and took me seriously I can’t drive bc of my disability and he would eventually drive several hours just to see me So I fell hard I had had a “normal” boyfriend before but this was intense lust passion Nothing like I’d ever felt But one weekend when he asked me to stay with him the first “incident” occurred He picked me up we drove a few hours He said he was tired and wanted to stop at a hotel even though we should have been almost at his house It was weird amp I knew something was wrong He wasn’t too tired bc we had sex in the hotel all night But when I woke up he was on the couch staring like in a trance And clutching a backpack I don’t think he was stoned it looked like he was having a hallucination When I touched him he snapped out of it and yelled at me amp grabbed me I got startled went to the bathroom Then I heard the door slam and my heart drop He’d left me there Abandoned me in a hotel like a prostitute I wasn’t mad I felt overwhelming fear abandonment rejection I called someone to get me and felt intense fear until they arrived I still deal with this Even if I go out to eat with someone amp they step away to the bathroom I feel overwhelmed afraid they won’t come back I let this jerk in again after a bs story and apology I tried blowing him off at first but I was weak My stepdad had just beat my little brother so bad that social services was investigating I hated my mom for not leaving I had no self esteem no direction I thought I needed him So the next time he promised me he wanted to make it up to me let me come live with him I decided to just stay a week to make sure I liked it bc I was anxious from the hotel incident But againthis time instead of stopping at a hotel he stopped at a bank Put on sunglasses amp grabbed the backpack Idk if it had drugs a gun idk Idk why he targeted me to begin with bc he didn’t initially know that I had a disability or home problems Anyway he told me to go inside and empty my account from my debit He went in with me My parents had used my money for a bill so it was empty and I think that saved my life He took me back to the car and thought for a few minutes then took me to a campground It was still cold outside I only saw one car there The camper was rusted and rundown The inside was trashed and looked like an episode of hoarders I’m not sure if he’d planned to bring me here in the first place Or if he’s taken other girls there There was a small tub filled with acorns bc it was squirrel infested I still have nightmares from the sounds of squirrels and mice running through the walls while the bugs and ants crawled on my skin in the dirty bedsheets I love animals amp the outdoors But it’s still hard to do things like hiking especially seeing a squirrel pop out and I can’t tell someone why I’m freaked He had sex with me in the camper in the late evening I’m not calling it rape bc I didn’t try to fight him off That’s part of my guilt and inability to tell my story why I don’t feel like a real victim But I was scared to death my fight or flight ego mode on I guess I had no idea why he’d brought me to this place what he was going to do with me how to deal etc survival mode maybe Or maybe that’s my excuse Bc I still enjoyed the sexy part I disassociated myself during that time while he was there with me sex was darkly twisted for me I still thought it meant love and he was my prince During the day and night though I was alone in there No food or water I was so hungry I tried to eat a can of soup out of one of the many trash bags but it was several years old and I puked I still can’t eat soup I had access to a cell amp told my mom I was ok and having a nice time I didn’t want my stepdad to know how stupid I was to need their help I was also still suicidal and at the same time fearing for my life I wanted mom to think I was happy if something did happen to me Thankfully my survival instincts truly kicked in after almost a week and I told her the truth I didn’t know where I was but she found me thanks to cell mapstechnology She got me while he was gone during the day I came home amp my stepdad hugged me sincerely for the first time in a decade He died soon after And I died inside Staring at the wall Mom pushing me to brush my teeth shower I did eventually wake up from the “death” that I felt But then I felt the pain And got addicted to porn one night standsetc I couldn’t handle real relationships I turned to domsub type relationships because I felt so ostracized from society no longer like a human but I made a good pet for cruel masters I’ve been going to church for a while now amp im finally past dealing or not dealing with things those ways But I still feel crippled by fear abandonment shame Not just by what happened but how I’ve wrecked my life afterwards dealing with it I’m done with how I did deal with things but I can’t find the courage to actually stand up on my own two legs and conquer what feels like the Great Wall of China Mines not a story of overcomingyet anyway But I hope other people learn lessons from it anyway I won’t tell young women to know their self worth and yada yada yada bc I cant seem to get that through my thick skull yet How about a lesson to others not to drive people to the point of weakness through cruelty and bullying that they feel it’s too late That’s one theme I’d like to drive home Your actions can have life threatening consequences on someone else And you never know what secrets and hurts and pain someone else is carrying And if you know of things going on that shouldn’t be don’t look the other way bc you feel you can’t make a difference Just being an ear can do something',\n",
